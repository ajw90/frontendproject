            Describing the content and layout for each page
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                This project is composed of three layers; the site begins with a home page (index.html); 
                this is fairly sparse, it contains a large div element in the centre; hovering over 
                this div, a dropdown menu - slightly crude due to its being constructed without 
                JavaScript - is exposed; from this one can access the “about me” section and the 
                coursework page - there is also a small feature enabling one to cycle the page 
                background from black to white and vice-versa. The home page is decorated by 
                two large divs; these have been distributed about the page; by setting the 
                border-radius, the height, and the width properties to identical, they have 
                been made circular; each has been given an abstract geometric gif background.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The “about me” page (aboutme.html) contains two relatively narrow, centred div 
                elements; the first from the top contains my personal profile; whenever any of the 
                paragraphs within this div are hovered over, the first word glows yellow. The 
                second div contains a link back to the home section.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The coursework page (coursework.html) contains three divs; the topmost contains a link 
                back to the home page; the other two are positioned horizontally adjacent to one 
                another using CSS flexbox; however, they are set to wrap vertically once the 
                screen narrows sufficiently. These latter divs contain links to the tasks from 
                the first and second units; these are arranged into nested unordered lists (ul); 
                there are only four pages for containing the individual tasks; however, the links 
                on the coursework page use the HTML “id” attribute to jump straight to the task 
                concerned within the relevant outcome page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the “about me” and coursework pages use the same style; the background 
                images both feature modernist architecture; the divs are styled to resemble a 
                traditional, 1980s terminal with a black background and mint green text (#00f0a0).
            </p>
            <p>
                From the coursework page, the third and deepest layer of the website is reached. 
                There are four pages, one for each outcome (unit&#60;n&#62;outcome&#60;m&#62;.html); all 
                four of these pages are designed according to an identical template; 
                the background consists of one large, rainbow-coloured gif; in the 
                foreground, there are a number of white divs; each of these contains a single 
                task and my response to the question, plus any references (where applicable); 
                these divs are initially translucent (opacity of 0.3); however, on hovering 
                over them, they become almost opaque (0.9), rendering the content readable. 
                At the top of this page is a thin orange bar with a down arrow symbol; when 
                one hovers over this, the arrow disappears, and, in its place, there appears 
                a similarly coloured menu bar; this contains links (spaced using CSS flexbox); 
                from here, one can navigate back to the coursework page or the home section - 
                thus completing the circle.

            Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                When building a website, particularly one bound for commercial use [3], it is 
                necessary to bear in mind that many of the written works, images, themes, 
                and even software [1] one may be tempted to include therein are subject to some 
                form of copyright. It is an error of judgement to assume that software is not 
                subject to the same protection as other works of intellectual property [2]. In 
                the UK, at least, original content obtains copyright protection at the moment of 
                creation [2], and there is no burden on the producer of said works to explicitly 
                mark this [2]. Failure to take note of this can involve the developer and/or 
                their business in legal difficulties and can incur penalties if considered 
                serious enough [4]. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When a developer is contemplating the use of content of which they themselves are not the 
                author, they must refer to any available information provided by said author pertaining to 
                the use of materials in order to avoid being in breach of the law.               
            </p>

            Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with 
            disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                Public facing websites and applications can come to be used by a wide array of people; 
                some of these people may, due to disability, face issues of accessibility; in order that 
                these customers are able to make effective use of the software, the developer should 
                investigate and implement software features to mitigate this [1]. To properly confront 
                this issue, consideration should be given to the categories of disability and how each 
                poses different barriers to use. Accessibility could also be said to entail considering 
                the different types of device a person might be using. What size is the screen? Does it 
                need to function with multiple languages? Will it make disproportionate demands on the 
                batteries of mobile devices? Does the website deliver basic functionality without 
                JavaScript and/or CSS? Should it? These are some of the questions it might be worth 
                considering [2].
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of techniques that can be utilised in providing accessible software to as 
                wide a range of users as possible: choose colours that contrast in such a way that makes 
                content easily readable for all people, including those with colour blindness; consider 
                keyboard only users [3]; use HTML elements for content, not layout [3]. Screen readers 
                are a variety of software used by the visually impaired to access on-screen content; they 
                parse displayed content and attempt, as faithfully as they can, to re-render it in braille 
                or via audio description [5]. There are resources on the web for testing how a given website 
                interacts with different accessibility software; for example, silktide.com [4] provides a 
                range of disability simulators with which developers can test their finished product before 
                release to market.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern HTML5 features a number of new elements known as semantic elements; these do not 
                generally alter the on-screen appearance or placement of content; however, they are designed 
                in such a way that accessibility software can interact with them and, in this way, make more 
                sense of the document in question and construct a logical picture of the document’s layout 
                and progression for the user [6].

            Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                A website can feature a wide array of different file types; the content of web pages is 
                generally described by HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) [1]; this is then parsed by the web 
                browser to populate the page according to the contents listed therein [1]; these files use the 
                extension “.html”. The style of a document is the responsibility of CSS (Cascading Style 
                Sheets) [2]; this can be embedded within the HTML document itself (“inline” [3]); however, 
                best practice prefers that this not be done [3]; CSS files are parsed by the browser and help 
                it decide how to display the associated HTML document’s content.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a scripting language [8] which has the distinction amongst 
                programming languages of being the most widely supported by major browsers; it 
                is used to implement dynamic behaviour and functionality within HTML documents 
                which would otherwise consist of static content [4]; JavaScript can be included 
                within a HTML document by its insertion within “&#60;script&#62;” tags or by referencing the URL at which the script is located [5].
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the above three file types, a website may feature a whole array of others 
                relating to its multimedia content - eg: “.mp4”, “.mp3”, “.png”, “.jpg”, etc [6]. 
                Whilst there has been a push for increasing standardisation, it is still difficult to 
                ensure that a given technology can be used on all platforms; one way of eluding this 
                particular risk is to make continuous use throughout the development cycle of online sources 
                indicating whether the file type in question can rendered by the target browser; caniuse.com 
                is an example of this type of resource [7].           
            </p>
