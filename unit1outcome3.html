            Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and 
            efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have 
            done it in teams?

                While my project was completed according to the timescales specified, I can identify a number 
                of ways in which, were I to do this again, I might increase the efficiency of development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Towards the end of the project, my use of Trello became a fairly routine matter of 
                creating and editing tasks simultaneous with their actually being completed; 
                however, initially, this did take some time to get used to. Getting into the 
                habit of using this as a regular part of the development cycle was of particular 
                benefit, as it assisted me in building a mental picture of the project overall and 
                helped in prioritising the workload. I could not truthfully describe my initial 
                failure to make use of this software as a drawback of the software itself, and, 
                once I started using it, it made a tremendous difference to my planning and helped 
                me to structure my time better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Were I to start the project again, with the benefit of experience, I would make more 
                sustained use of Trello throughout and benefit from this enhanced efficiency from the 
                outset.
            </p> 
            <p>
                It is very easy to conceive of this task being completed by a team of developers; 
                the delegation of different sections of the website could have significantly 
                increased the pace of development and reduced the time taken to finish the 
                overall work. Standup meetings [1] would be an excellent way to ensure that 
                all members of the team were on-track; additionally, Trello’s facility for 
                marking tasks according to those team members bearing responsibility for 
                them, would provide an effective picture of each person’s contribution to 
                the project.

                There are a number of things that can be done to enhance the efficiency of a project; 
                this efficiency is very often a function of the proper division of labour, and the extent 
                to which good use has been made of planning at the very start [1]. A project should 
                be partitioned into manageable stages and each one of these should, in turn, be 
                divided into logical sub-projects; planning for this at the very outset of the 
                project will ensure that the organisation benefits from each person’s talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trello is an excellent contribution to a project’s productivity and efficiency 
                inasmuch as it offers features that naturally facilitate the aforementioned 
                division of labour; tasks can be divided up logically according to their 
                state of completion, their category, and who has responsibility for them. 
                This approach will yield much better results than attempting to tackle the 
                project as an undivided whole, only handling issues as and when they emerge [2].
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonetheless, it must be emphasised that planning should not be so rigid as to 
                stifle the flexibility a team requires to tackle issues as and when they 
                emerge - and in large projects, they almost certainly will emerge.

            Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do 
            differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                Were I required to improve the efficiency of this project and others through the use 
                of digital tools and resources, there are a few changes I would make to this end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, were the resources available, I would assign the project to a team; given a 
                proper division of the tasks involved along logical lines - eg, division according 
                to different pages, division of content and styling - I feel that the work could 
                have been completed in a mere fraction of the time actually taken. By employing 
                standup meetings to ensure that all team members are up-to-date, making use of 
                Trello to document how the tasks are being divided and what progress is being 
                made, and sharing resources and notifications via Slack, it would be possible to 
                leverage the advantages of the division of labour as a boon to productivity [1].
            </p>
            <p>
                The briefing for this project specified that we were to work alone and make use of only 
                HTML and CSS; however, given freedom to do otherwise, I would delegate out the 
                work amongst a team (inclusive of myself) and I would ensure the use of 
                JavaScript alone to build the website’s functionality, as per the orthodoxy 
                of using HTML for content, CSS for style, and JavaScript for behaviour 
                (separation of concerns) [2].

            Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                I did run a number of very rudimentary tests on the functioning and navigability of 
                the website; using Git, I made the project accessible to myself at home. 
                Initially, I tested the computer on Google Chrome and Firefox on my own 
                laptop; the operating system was Linux Mint. I then moved the project 
                into the Apache server directory on my home computer; having done so, I 
                was able to access it on my and my families’ Android phones, again using 
                multiple web browsers. For all of these browser-device combinations, 
                while there was some variation in the placement of on-screen content, 
                the site remained entirely navigable, functional, and readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Naturally, I would incorporate this kind of device and browser testing into any 
                project undertaken in future; however, I would probably do this in a more 
                streamlined manner. There are a number of online resources that can help in 
                this regard, with one such example being responsivedesignchecker.com [2].
            </p>
            <p>
                Were I to design this website with JavaScript, I would additionally consider 
                writing some unit tests to establish that any functions and/or objects 
                involved were performing as required. I would try to design these portions 
                of code in such a way as would make them suitable for unit testing [1]; by 
                making sure these individual component parts worked in isolation, I would, 
                ideally, increase the likelihood of their working together in the completed 
                project.
