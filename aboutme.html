        <h1>About Me</h1> 
        <hr/>          
        <p>
            My name is Andrew Winters; I am 29 years old at the time of writing, 
            and I am currently attending the 3-week Develop Course at Code Nation 
            in Chester.            
        </p>
        <p>
            I have some previous experience of programming, 
            having developed an 
            interest in the subject after finding a copy of the book, The C 
            Programming Language, in a charity shop in 2008 (I still have it). 
            In time I progressed to looking into various other programming topics, 
            particularly web development, and I do still have some of the - perhaps 
            slightly outdated - work from that time period. However, due to work 
            commitments, I let this interest fall somewhat into the background.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing that did endure from this time period is my use of the Linux 
            operating system at home, and I like to think that this has kept my IT 
            skills somewhat more up-to-date than they might otherwise be, since 
            using this OS day-to-day does occasionally require some in-depth 
            problem solving.          
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, whilst working at Chester Jobcentre near the end of a 
            fixed-term contract, I came to learn of Code Nation through their 
            admissions team, who were visiting the site to talk to staff and 
            customers about the courses they offer. I took a look at their website 
            and concluded that taking this course would be an excellent step in the 
            right direction. I would like, at this point in my life, to start a 
            career, ideally doing something that I have an interest in; I enjoy 
            coding and problem solving generally, and I relish the idea of 
            developing usable products whilst continuously learning and 
            updating my skills within the industry.            
        </p>       
        <p>
            I have enjoyed the course thus far; the syllabus has allowed me to 
            rekindle my disused coding skills and learn about industry-specific 
            collaborative tools; I feel that this course has been very beneficial 
            in that it hasn’t taught coding alone but also the other equally vital 
            skills (research, digital teamwork, etc) required in modern development; 
            I hope, on completing this course, to continue learning with the organisation 
            through their Master Course.
