            Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, 
            are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                During the building of my website, I have made use of a number of tools from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the writing and editing of code, I used Visual Studio Code; this has been of 
                tremendous help from when the project was begun; this particular text editor provides a 
                number of features which make coding more convenient. The editor is able to adopt 
                different highlighting modes based on the language in use within a document; to an 
                extent, it is able to predictively auto-complete what one is writing based upon words 
                previously used and key words in the language of choice; for example, when editing in 
                JavaScript, one can type the name of an object followed by a dot; the editor will then 
                enumerate that object’s properties, allowing them to be selected quickly. Gradually, these small time-savings accumulate 
                to drastically scale up the speed of development.       
            </p>
            <p>
                For version control and securing against potential loss of work, I have made use of 
                Github in concert with Git. The combination of these two tools has meant that not only 
                have I been able to save my work at various stages of completion, ensuring that it can 
                be retrieved in the event of its being lost [1], but I have also been able to move it 
                onto my own personal computer by duplicating the repository. As someone who wishes to move 
                into the tech sector professionally in the future, having this resource as a place to store work 
                in an easily accessed central location, is of great benefit - both as a stable storage place 
                and as a portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have made use of Trello to keep track of where I am with regards to my work and its 
                overall progress; Trello consists of an online “board” on which one can make and arrange 
                “cards” representing tasks; these can can be labelled according to category, allowing 
                for a clearer breakdown of the workload. On top of this, I made use of the Kanban [2] 
                principle; this involves the division of tasks into the categories, "to-do", "doing", and 
                "done". Whilst combining them is not mandatory, Trello and Kanban seem almost tailor-made 
                for one another, and using them together really helped to keep me organised throughout the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I have been very satisfied with the tools used during this project; they have 
                each, in their own way, made my working much more efficient and enjoyable; it is also 
                encouraging to become comfortable and familiar with tools which are used extensively 
                by professionals in the tech sector.

            Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                I would say that the tools used were more than appropriate; each one of them made the 
                development process easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code was particularly well suited to this project; it provides a side-panel 
                breakdown of the entire project with all of its files and subdirectories, an attached terminal view 
                which defaults to the project’s root directory, and language-specific syntax highlighting and 
                auto-complete features; these along with other editor facilities like multiple-cursor mode massively 
                enhance the efficiency of development. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine developing a project of 
                any great scale without these features. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trello was similarly appropriate; being based in the browser, it is easily accessible 
                from multiple locations; its simple “card” and “board” system allows one to quickly 
                generate new tasks and move them, using a convenient and well implemented drag-and-drop 
                facility, into lists appropriate to their category and level of completion; this enables the developer to maintain a good mental 
                picture of the project’s design and current level of progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tools used in developing this project were very well suited to the task at hand; 
                there are doubtless many equivalent tools in existence which offer the same 
                functionality, but those mentioned carry the additional benefit of widespread use in the industry [1, 2]. 
                For all but the smallest projects, these tools are virtually indispensable.

            Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? 
            Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you 
            change?
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                Overall, I am reasonably pleased with the progress I have made on this completed 
                website; our briefing for this task specified that it was to be an exercise in 
                HTML and CSS alone; therefore, some of the functionality which could have been 
                implemented in JavaScript perhaps does lack the polish it would otherwise have. 
                However, I do believe that the website’s main features have been implemented to a 
                reasonable standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website is navigable; there are no dead ends throughout the project, and one can 
                easily return to the main landing page from any of the site’s sub sections. In order 
                to test my own abilities, I decided to attempt implementing some features in CSS which 
                would ordinarily be coded in JavaScript; eg: a drop down menu on the site’s home page, 
                the ability to switch the home page theme by exploiting the CSS ":target" pseudoclass and the document's body element. I 
                very likely would not choose to include this type of thing on a project built for a professional 
                client (unless requested); however, on this occasion, I decided to incorporate them for the purpose of 
                showcasing CSS ability, and I am ultimately pleased with the result.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel that the code for this project exhibits uniformity of formatting and is 
                consequently quite readable; I decided to use a four-space system of indentation [1] 
                and camel-case [2] throughout; I found that this made navigating and amending the 
                source code much more simple than it would have been had no such system been used.

            Describe further improvements you can make to your project
        </h3>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>
                Whilst I am ultimately satisfied with the end product, there are things about this project that I 
                feel could be improved upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given time to do so, I would like to have applied principles of responsive design and, thus, 
                provided a more uniform and pleasing user experience across different devices and browsers. 
                I did open the website on my and several of my family members' Android phones by serving it 
                via Apache on my home computer, and it did appear correctly, exhibiting the same overall level 
                of functionality; all content was readable and navigable. Nonetheless, I feel that this website 
                could benefit from the application of CSS media queries [1] to help the various elements render 
                in a manner more suited to individual platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I would probably implement some of the more involved features - eg, the dropdown 
                menu on the main home page - in JavaScript; however, this would go against 
                the briefing for this project, and it was fun to experiment with CSS in this way - indeed, seeing what can be done with HTML and CSS alone
                may prove useful in future from a progressive enhancement [2] perspective.

                Examining the requirements given for this project, I am reasonably confident that I have managed 
                to meet them. To instance this, I will explore a sample of the requirements and how I have met 
                each of them.

                “2.1 Preparing appropriate content for your site”

            </h4>
            <p>
                I obtained imagery from online sources to use in the design of the site; the 
                majority of the written content was created in the process of answering the various 
                questions for the coursework portion of this project. When answering these questions, it is necessary to provide 
                references anywhere where stating anything that could be construed as a personal opinion; we were asked to avoid using 
                Wikipedia, owing to its editable nature; I have also chose to provide extra references where referencing terms specific 
                to the field in order to provide further clarification. 
            </p>
            <h4>

                good navigation”
            </h4>
            <p>
                In order to render the source code for this project easily readable, navigable, and 
                amendable I decided very early on to adopt and apply a uniform formatting style 
                which made use of four-space indenting and camel-case [1].
            </p>
            <p>
                The navigability of the completed website is ensured by the regular appearance of 
                navigation bars and links; these are generally styled in such a way that they 
                change colour, increase in size, or grow in boldness on being hovered over; 
                there is a relatively clear progression from the landing page through the 
                menu page and, finally, down to the individual coursework pages; returning to 
                the home page is easily managed from anywhere in the overall project.

            <p>
                I have tested the website on a number of different devices and browsers (the Mac used for 
                development, Firefox and Linux on my home computer, my and my family members’ Android 
                phones); with each browser-platform combination, the content rendered in such a manner as 
                was readable and navigable; I have stress-tested the website on all of these platforms and 
                have not detected any dead ends or obstruction of content. The colour scheme and backgrounds 
                used ensure that the written content is visible and easily followed; eg: background opacity 
                is turned off when the user hovers over an element allowing its content to be seen more 
                readily.
